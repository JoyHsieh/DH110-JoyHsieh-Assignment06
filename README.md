# DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment06
## Introduction
This project is for a platform called **Pensieve**. The goal of Pensieve is to help senior citizens record their life stories and share them with friends and family. When it is complete, this high-fidelity prototype will help me visualize the design, make usability improvements, and optimize the design. For now, this high-fidelity wireframe will showcase the design of the final product.  

This prototype will allow users to:

- watch a tutorial video to learn how to use the website
- select a prompt to write about
- write a story
- upload a video or voice recording of a story
- view stories that were previously written
- share the story with others

### Design Variations

## Impression Test
## Accessibility Check
Unfortunately, Stark is not able to check text against multicolored backgrounds so I was limited in what I could test.

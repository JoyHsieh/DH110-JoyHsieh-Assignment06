# DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment06
## Introduction
This project is for a platform called **Pensieve**. The goal of Pensieve is to help senior citizens record their life stories and share them with friends and family. When it is complete, this high-fidelity prototype will help me visualize the design, make usability improvements, and optimize the design. For now, this high-fidelity wireframe will showcase the design of the final product.  

Ultimately, this product will allow users to:

- watch a tutorial video to learn how to use the website
- select a prompt to write about
- write a story
- upload a video or voice recording of a story
- view stories that were previously written
- share the story with others
(see below for prototype functionalities)

## Screen Design

### Design Variations

## Impression Test
I asked some friends to take a look at the screen design and design variations. Here is what they said:

**Sharon**
> The colorful background creates a nice contrast and makes the buttons you can press easier to see. I like the color background with the white prompt boxes because it looks more cohesive.

**Hellen**
> I like the pink one hahaha i just think itâ€™s neat!

**Andy**
> The colors are nice. I like the rainbow one best. I don't know how practical it is to share by email. You should do a link or something instead.

Overall, the lighter colored designs had a more favorable impression. I'm going to take Andy's suggestion into account for my next revision.

## Accessibility Check

Unfortunately, Stark is not able to check text against multicolored backgrounds so I was limited in what I could test. See the error message below.

## Interactive Prototype
view the prototype on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/1u7553IPa6LgAZey8nxkDp/DH110-Prototype?node-id=6%3A891&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1).

#### Task A: Write a New Story
- Select a prompt
- Write the story
- Share the story
- Return Home

#### Task B: Share an Old Story
- See previously written stories
- Share the story
- Return Home

## Wireflow

This wireflow includes updates to the "Share Your Story" page and has an added "Success" page to confirm that the story has been shared.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
My group forgot to record, but below are some screenshots from our chat with comments on my prototype.

#### Summary of Findings
Overall, my group thought my prototype had a clean and cute interface and was simple and easy to navigate. They made the following suggestions:
- Change the side bar nome navigation to a smaller logo or top banner to make it more intuitive as a "Home" button
- Add a "View My Stories" button to the "Write My Story" page
- Add a "Save" button or system status message (ex: "Your story was automatically saved x seconds ago") to the "Write My Story" page
- Add a "Home" button to the "Success" page

## Reflection
I really enjoyed prototyping! It was very difficult at first, but when it started coming together and looking nice it was really exciting. I started by trying to get a logo and design system down to make the rest of the process go more smoothly. It was hard to come up with these and figure out exactly what I want. I wish I had been able to complete the accessibility test more thoroughly. The impression test and cognitive walkthrough were really helpful and I recieved a lot of constructive feedback. Based on these tests, I made changes to the sharing function and will make future changes based off of the list in the "Summary of Findings" list above.

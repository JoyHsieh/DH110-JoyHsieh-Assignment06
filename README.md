# DH110-JoyHsieh-Assignment06
## Introduction
This project is for a platform called **Pensieve**. The goal of Pensieve is to help senior citizens record their life stories and share them with friends and family. When it is complete, this high-fidelity prototype will help me visualize the design, make usability improvements, and optimize the design. For now, this high-fidelity wireframe will showcase the design of the final product.  

Ultimately, this product will allow users to:

- watch a tutorial video to learn how to use the website
- select a prompt to write about
- write a story
- upload a video or voice recording of a story
- view stories that were previously written
- share the story with others
(see below for prototype functionalities)

### Design Variations

## Impression Test
I asked some friends to take a look at the screen design and design variations. Here is what they said:

**Sharon**
> The colorful background creates a nice contrast and makes the buttons you can press easier to see. I like the color background with the white prompt boxes because it looks more cohesive.

**Hellen**
> I like the pink one hahaha i just think it’s neat!

**Andy**
> The colors are nice. I like the rainbow one best. I don't know how practical it is to share by email. You should do a link or something instead.

Overall, the lighter colored designs had a more favorable impression. I'm going to take Andy's suggestion into account for my next revision.

## Accessibility Check

Unfortunately, Stark is not able to check text against multicolored backgrounds so I was limited in what I could test. See the error message below.

#### Task A: Write a New Story
- Select a prompt
- Write the story
- Share the story
- Return Home

#### Task B: Share an Old Story
- See previously written stories
- Share the story
- Return Home

## Cognitive Walkthrough
My group forgot to record, but below are some screenshots from our chat with comments on my prototype.

#### Summary of Findings
Overall, my group thought my prototype had a clean and cute interface and was simple and easy to navigate. They made the following suggestions:
- Change the side bar nome navigation to a smaller logo or top banner to make it more intuitive as a "Home" button
- Add a "View My Stories" button to the "Write My Story" page
- Add a "Save" button or system status message (ex: "Your story was automatically saved x seconds ago") to the "Write My Story" page
- Add a "Home" button to the "Success" page

## Reflection
I really enjoyed prototyping! It was very difficult at first, but when it started coming together and looking nice it was really exciting. The cognitive walkthrough was really helpful and my group had a lot of constructive feedback.
